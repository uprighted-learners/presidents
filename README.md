# Presidents

# Objective

## Learning

In this exercise we will be practicing array manipulation, and filtering, as well as accessing object properties using an array of presidential data. We will also learn the utility of array methods and calculations.

Topics

- .forEach()
- .filter()
- Array destructuring
- Object properties
- Age calculations
- Conditional logic
- console.log()

## Achieving

In this exercise, we will be creating various filtered lists and calculations from our presidents array data.

Your work will result in:

- Total count of presidents
- Filtered lists of living and deceased presidents
- Age calculations for presidents at time of death
- Current age calculations for living presidents

# Procedure

- Use array length to count total presidents
- Create a living presidents list 
    - Filter presidents where passed property is undefined
- Create a deceased presidents list
- Calculate ages at death
    - Loop through deceased presidents array
    - Calculate age
    - Display first name, last name, and age at death
- Calculate current ages
    - Filter for living presidents
    - Calculate current age
    - Display president names and current ages

# Review

In this exercise, we have written code that filters and manipulates presidential data to extract useful information and perform age calculations.

## Going Further

- Add sorting by age at death
- Calculate average presidential lifespan
- Find presidents who lived the longest/shortest
- Group presidents by century of birth
